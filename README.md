# GoPractice
A repository for exploring google go. There are tests in there.

Q1) Write a function that sorts a bunch of words by the number of character “a”s within the word (decreasing order). If some words contain the same amount of character “a”s then you need to sort those words by their lengths. 

Q2) Write a recursive function which takes one integer parameter. Please bear in mind that finding the algorithm needed to generate the output below is the main point of the question.

Q3) Write a function which takes one parameter as an array/list. Find most repeated data
within a given array.


## Run one of the TestQs

```
cd sorts-a-bunch-of-words-q1-main
go run .
